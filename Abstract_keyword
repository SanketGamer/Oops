//abstract keyword
//1. we can not create object of a abstract class. we can create a refference of a object class
//2. abstract keyword can be use in method but we have to asign abstract class means a abstract class not need abstract method but a abstract method need abstract class
//3. If we want to use an abstract class, we must inherit it in a child class and implement its abstract methods.
